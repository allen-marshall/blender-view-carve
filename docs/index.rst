   usage

View Carve is a Blender_ addon that allows users to cut meshes into pieces, using other
3D objects as "stencils" to control the cut. The stencil objects (aka "carvers") are projected through the 3D viewport
to make the cut, so you can typically see what the cut will look like before making it.
