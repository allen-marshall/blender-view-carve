View Carve is a [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) addon for carving mesh objects based on projections of other objects in the 3D viewport.

See [the documentation](https://blender-view-carve.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Project status

This project is not currently maintained because, as far as I know, it no longer has any users. As of 2023-10-15, I would be willing to resume maintenance if there is anyone interested in using the addon. Feel free to open an issue if that is the case. I probably won't add any major features but could work on fixing issues, updating the code to work with newer Blender versions, and trying to simplify the installation process.
